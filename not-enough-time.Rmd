To Have Enough Time
===================

There's not enough time! There's no way I can get that done in *two days*!

<salutation>

How do *you* react when you have to do something on very short notice?

If you're like my daughter, this happens all the time, because you leave 
*everything* to the last minute. For her, two days might even be too much time,
and she'd have to wait a bit longer before getting started. She seems to thrive 
on knowing that it *has* to be done by 11:59pm tonight.

If you're like me, the predominant feeling is "too much". I start to feel 
overwhelmed, and then I think about all the thousand and one other things I also
need to do within the next two days. And then the panic sets in, and I start
to think that *none* of them will get done. And then I remember that there is
ice cream in the freezer, and before I know it, the container mysteriously
has appeared on the counter with a spoon next to it. No no no, this is
*not helping*!

Stop. Pause.

Take a deep breath in through the nose, right into the belly. Let it out, 
slowly, through the mouth. Wait a moment. Take another deep breath, just the
same. Let it out. Take a third breath, even deeper than the first two. Let it
out. Take a moment to feel the silence.

Take another moment to feel the chair beneath you, and your feet on the 
floor. Continue to breathe deeply. If a thought pops into your head, let it be
there for a moment, and then let it drift away, like a cloud in a summer sky. 
Bring your attention gently back to the breath. This is not the time to attend 
to other things. There will be time for them later. Breathe, deeply.

Ever so gently, be aware that the mind is thinking, because that is what minds
do. Pay brief attention to one of the thoughts, say to yourself "thinking", 
and, because you are not going to engage with it now, let it drift away. Come
back, gently, to the breath.

When you are ready, bring your attention back to the room around you. Feel the
chair that supports you and the floor beneath your feet. Remember that there is
only one of you, and, in the world you are returning to, resolve to take things 
one at a time, because you can only devote your attention to things one at
a time.

Now, back to work.

Choose one of your tasks to work on first. For 25 minutes, focus exclusively
on that task. Note where you got to. Then take a five-minute break. Get up and 
walk around. Then decide what to do next: to continue with the same task, or
to switch to another one. 25 minutes is a good time to get the mind involved
in the complexities of a task, but not so long that you will get bored. The 
writer Neil Gaiman uses a similar idea. During his writing time, he does not
allow himself to do anything else apart from writing. The only other thing
he allows himself is to sit and do nothing, but eventually he gets so bored
with that he figures "I might as well be writing", and off he goes.

My daughter's approach of leaving everything to the last minute doesn't always
work out well. When I called her last Monday, she was like "Daddy, I need five
literary devices for my story", and once she had calmed down a bit, we
talked about metaphor and simile and imagery and exposition and colloquialism, 
and found out where she had used them without even thinking that she had,
and she was good to go.

The words you are listening to now first hit the page last Sunday night. 
But I sat down and started writing, without worrying about other
things I might be doing, because there is only one of me, and the other things
can wait until later. Just as you can, I started with some deep breathing,
getting myself calm, and then picked something to be doing, namely, writing
this speech. After a break, I will do the first round of practicing and 
editing (the two go together for me), and tomorrow night I will make sure 
that everything is memorized and ready to share with you.

So, next time you find yourself saying "there's not enough time!", rest assured
that by applying enough calmness and focus, there *is* enough time, and despite
what you may think, you *can* do it.
